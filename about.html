    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>THE SITE</h2>
    <p>
        This site is a collection of odd theories and answerless questions of fictional media that I like and think
        about. If what I write here isn't in your know then that's fine, I didn't write these to sell any sort of idea,
        I wrote them to put them out there in case somebody that does care stumbles across them, and to put these
        concepts on the digital footprint so they won't fade away. <br>
        To note this site isn't meant to be taken with seriousness, but I do try to keep up a competent appearance.

    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>
        About me? I'm just some guy born in the mid 2000's who grew up surrounded by a pre-kid exploitive internet,
        which has
        it's ups and downs. I'm consistently drawn to the fictional worlds surrounding video games, and that's primarily
        what led to the creation of this site. I'm good at drawing sprites I guess, though I'm consistently mediocre at
        my number one time waster, video games. <br>
        I am also responsible for all the graphic designs on the site. Some represent fictional characters, and those
        are related to their specific article.
